Efficient Anagram Finder

This project implements a highly efficient anagram finder in C++. It utilizes custom hash tables and linked lists to efficiently manage a large collection of words and their anagrams. The implementation includes custom hashing algorithms, collision resolution, and dynamic resizing for optimal performance. This code demonstrates proficiency in data structures, algorithm design, and efficient memory management.
